DVB driver for Earthsoft PT3 (ISDB-S/T) receiver PCI Express cards.
It behaves similarly as PT1 DVB, plus some tuning enhancements:
1. in addition to the real frequency:
	ISDB-S : freq. channel ID
	ISDB-T : freq# (I/O# +128), ch#, ch# +64 for CATV
2. in addition to TSID:
	ISDB-S : slot#

Feature changes:
- dropped DKMS & standalone compile
- dropped verbosity (debug levels), use single level -DDEBUG instead
- changed SNR (.read_snr) to CNR (.read_signal_strength)
- moved demodulator FE to drivers/media/dvb-frontends
- moved tuners to drivers/media/tuners
- translated to standard (?) I2C protocol
- dropped FE's LNB control & other unused features
- added DVBv5 stats support (only CNRs)

The full package (buildable as standalone, DKMS or tree embedded module) is available at
